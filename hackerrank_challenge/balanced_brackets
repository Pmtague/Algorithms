Write a function that takes a string as input. The string can contain four types of brackets: "[]", "()", "{}", "||". Your function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the string is balanced. Note that pipes brackets use the same character to indicate both opening and closing.

A String is considered balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a given type as it has closing brackets of that same type. No bracket can be left unmatched if the string is to be considered balanced. A closing bracket also cannot match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it. Brackets also cannot overlap each other, i.e., "[(])".

Examples:
"[(])" should return False
"foo(bar)baz" should return True
"{{||[]||}}" should return True
"I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated." should return True
"I (wa)n{t to buy a on}esie[...] b(u{[t] kno}w it) won't suit me." should return True
"This is t(he la[st random sentence I will be writing |and| I am going to stop mid-sent]" should return False

Note that HackerRank's expected output from your code will be a 0 indicating False or a 1 indicating True. You may opt to retrb 1 and 0 as your truthy and falsey values, or actual booleans True and False; either option will work. HackerRank's platform will coerce a true value to 1 and a false value to 0 behind the scenes.
